The default or home page has three sets of objects: 

There is the main timetable window that shows the timetable defined by days of week and predefined time slots of the day.  The timetable window will show the scheduled resources as links in the various timeslots. These resources are abbreviated as the subject code+class group ID+resource index. A resource index indicate the type of resource such as  a lecture, a lab or a tutorial. 

A timeslot for a day can have zero, one or more resources. Clicking on the link in a timeslot which has at least one resource will cause a new window to be displayed. This provides the details for the resources in the timeslots.    

For each resource the following details will be provided.
